## ðŸ’¡ About the project

This project consists of create a shell, simulating bash


![Minihell Capture](https://github.com/jariza-o/MiniShell/blob/main/minishell.png)

## Deployment

Minishell runs executables from an absolute, relative or environment PATH (/bin/ls or ls), including arguments or options "and" work the same as bash.

All slow possible errors are controlled.

You can use redirections > >> < and pipes |.

<p>Enviroment variables are handled, including the return code $?.</p>

Finally, you can use Ctrl-C to interrupt and Ctrl-\ to quit a program, as well as Ctrl-D to throw an EOF, same as in bash.

A few of the functions are "built-in", meaning we don't call the executable, we re-coded them directly. It's the case for echo, pwd, cd, env, export, unset and exit.
